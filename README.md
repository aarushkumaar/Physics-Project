ðŸ§  Quantum Physics Simulation Project
ðŸŽ® An Interactive Visualizer for Quantum Mechanical Phenomena
This web-based simulator is designed to visually demonstrate fundamental quantum mechanical concepts through intuitive and interactive simulations. It offers real-time visualization of wave functions and quantum behavior, making abstract physics more accessible and engaging.

ðŸ§ª Simulators Included
ðŸ”¹ 1. Particle in a Box
Simulates a quantum particle confined within a 1D infinite potential well.

Visualizes the standing wave patterns for different quantum numbers (n).

Animated wave function evolves with time.

Toggle button to pause and resume the animation.

Real-time quantum number adjustment.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Tunneling Effect
Demonstrates quantum tunneling: a particle with energy E approaching a potential barrier of height Vâ‚€.

Shows how the wave function decays inside the barrier when E < Vâ‚€.

Visualizes the "tunneling" into the classically forbidden region.

Sliders for adjusting barrier height and particle energy.

Real-time animation toggle.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack
HTML: Semantic and structured layout for each simulator page.

CSS: Responsive design, interactive UI, and shared styling across pages.

JavaScript: Canvas-based rendering, real-time signal updates, and animation logic.

ðŸ§­ Navigation
A unified navbar at the top allows smooth transitions between different simulators:

ðŸš€ Future Scope
Add a simulator for the Double Slit Experiment

Visualize the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

Add an energy level diagram for clarity

Export waveforms or animations as images/gifs

ðŸ“š Educational Purpose
This project bridges the gap between theoretical quantum mechanics and visual learning. Itâ€™s ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to explore quantum concepts through simulation.
