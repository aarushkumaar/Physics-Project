# Physics-Project
 This project is a web-based simulator that visually demonstrates key quantum physics concepts like the Particle in a Box and Tunneling Effect. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers interactive controls, real-time animations, and an intuitive interface to make complex quantum phenomena easier to understand.
